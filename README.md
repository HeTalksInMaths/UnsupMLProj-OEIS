# Unsupervised Machine Learning Project: Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).

The impact of outliers on K-means versus K-medoids on clustering data from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) is studied.

The data files are located in the "Data" folder with only oeisvals.csv used in the code but oeisnames.csv is also provided as a reference to provide context to the integer sequences. The ipynb file is self-contained and downloads the data from a public Google Drive folder. Alternatively the data can be downloaded at this link https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-06-28-oeis-download/.

The Jupyter notebook of the work and video presentation slides are also found here.
